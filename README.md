## Install

1. Install the dependencies (node_modules) using the `npm install` or `npm i` command.

2. Save the `.env.example` file as `.env` and fill in the necessary data. We have left some additional data on the `.env.example` for the email service to work.

3. Run `npm run initDb` to create the necessary tables in the database.

4. Run `npm run dev` or `node --watch app.js` to launch the server.

5. When using `Postman` keep in mind that, in order to be able to change the password with the recovery code, you need to register with a real and fucntioning email to be able to receive the temporary code that allows you to change passwords.
